# RUCI

<ins>R</ins>ust <ins>U</ins>niversal <ins>C</ins>ess <ins>I</ins>nterface.

This crate is for parsing and creating UCI messages.
It follows the [UCI standard](https://backscattering.de/chess/uci).

It is intentionally not published on crates.io because it doesn't have tests yet and I'm not confident in it, but I need to use it in a project of mine hence it's getting published on GitHub.

The docs can be found at <https://tigerros.github.io/ruci>.
